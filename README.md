# Static AKAdvent

This contains all a template to build a static version of an advent calendar based on the [AKAdvent Wordpress Theme](https://github.com/AkaBlas/AKAdvent-Theme).

## TODO:

1. Add notes on exporting an advent calendar into this format
2. pin footer to the bottom of the page - Hirsch doesn't know enough CSS for that
3. Add a license as well?
